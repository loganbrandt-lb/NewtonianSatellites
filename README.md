# NewtonianSatellites

# Very simple physics simulation with realistic satellite orbits based on Newton's laws of gravity.

# Open project with Unity 3D or simply run the executable! Click and drag anywhere on the screen to launch a new satellite. The length of the drag will determine the satellites initial velocity. 

# Built with only free assets from the Unity Asset Store.
